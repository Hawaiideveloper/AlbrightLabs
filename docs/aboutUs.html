<h1> Why? </h1>
We are doing this for one main reason.  People out there need our help.  They don't have a plane ticket, a place to stay, and
and the resources needed to create something that will get them out of poverty.

<h1> What is it?</h1>
This is a huge warehouse that has been converted into a large facility to train, create patents, and provide opportunity width
royalities to those who are less fortunate.

<h1> How?</h1>
We partnered with local and community banks to purchase the land, equipment, and the human capital to teach for free to those
who want to invent and create something that will get them out of poverty.

<h1> Can I join? </h1>
That depends, if you are buying or selling.  If you are selling is your product free?  Does it give opportunity to someone and 
allow them to learn a valuable skill that can be sold later on?
If you are buying, sure come down and visit our and see the products we create.

<h1> When?</h1>
January 16, 2023 our facility will be open to the general public.  You don't need to be in poverty you just need to prove that 
you either want to teach machine shop, or learn machine shop.  If you want to work on other projects such as our flying cars, or 
sustainable energy projects you can look fill out the form within our login page.
